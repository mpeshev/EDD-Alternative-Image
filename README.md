# EDD-Alternative-Image

An alternative featured image for Easy Digital Downloads' [downloads] page

By default, EDD's [downloads] shortcode provides a wonderful grid for your downloadables. However, a ratio may vary between your standard featured image and the rectangular thumbnail in EDD's grid.

EDD Alternative Image provides a second metabox for setting an alternative image that is being used by Easy Digital Download's grid while your single download views pull your original featured image. This would allow you to upload two different image version for both screens.
